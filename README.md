# DoYouKnowFlash
This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) quiz that I made when I had just started off with JavaScript.

# How to play the game ?
This is CLI means you'll need a terminal (Linux - Bash, Windows - Git bash, MacOS - iTerm, Zsh etc.) to play the quiz.

- We use Node.js as the runtime environment to run the JS code.
- `npm install` for installing the necessary packages.
- `node index.js` to run the quiz.
